## Framework Agnostic

This website has many versions, just to show we can all co-exist and all frameworks are ok!. Do what you feel most comfortable with, as for me, i am a fan of Vue.js but i don't endorse framework sectarism so you will find a version in..:

- HTML/CSS/JS ✅
- Vue.js ✅
- Angular (to do)
- React (to do)
- Gatsby (to do)
