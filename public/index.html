									<p>Being a DevOps/SysAdmin totally rocks. Being a developer rocks!. Being a Vue Vixen rocks my socks. But why?, don't we all suffer at some point? - probably on a daily basis. I am often seen arguing with my computer and also cheering when things work. It hasn't changed since day one. You won't see a lot of swanky things but here i share my projects and all the reasons that make me love doing what i do! 💜</p>

												<h4><a href="https://vuevixens.org/team">Vue Vixens Worldwide Community Organiser</a></h4>
												<p>Vue Vixens is an initiative founded by Jen Looper, Developer Advocate at Progress, that creates and hosts workshops to teach Vue.js to under-represented people in a cool and fun way. It is based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular community (ng-girls.org) who was in turn inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives. The format involves self-driven code labs completed in a workshop format in groups with mentoring by conference-goers and speakers who volunteer to help. The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such with Vue.js in a supportive and inclusive environment. We also help conferences organize their diversity initiatives such as offering free conference tickets, and are building a scholarship fund to help offset those attendees' conference costs so that they can more easily attend.
